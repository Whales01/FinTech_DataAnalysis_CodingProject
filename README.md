# FinTech_DataAnalysis_CodingProject
This script is written to compare and analyse the historical performance of four individual equity assets against a market benchmark over an approximately 8-year period, focusing on their returns and risk characteristics in order to evaluate their relative performance and risk-adjusted viability.

This code is divided into three main sections, beginning with the calculation and exploration of asset returns, followed by linear regression–based performance metrics, and finally visualising these relationships against the market benchmark.

# Section 1:
This section compute the daily and cumulative returns for each asset, visualize the distribution of results using time-series plots and box plots, and calculate both daily and annualized standard deviations to measure volatility.

# Section 2:
This section calculate risk-adjusted performance using the Sharpe ratio and perform linear regression analysis to determine the Alpha and Beta coefficients for each asset relative to the market benchmark.

# Section 3:
This section visualize the correlation between each asset and the benchmark using scatter plots and illustrate the relationship by plotting the line of best fit.
